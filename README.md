## 📝 ToDoList

This is a web application that allows for simple task management.
It enables adding, editing, and deleting tasks. Tasks can be 
marked as completed or reverted back to incomplete. The app allows
you to set deadlines for tasks and displays them by showing 
incomplete tasks first, sorted by date. You can also create,
edit, and delete tags, as well as assign multiple tags to 
a single task.
